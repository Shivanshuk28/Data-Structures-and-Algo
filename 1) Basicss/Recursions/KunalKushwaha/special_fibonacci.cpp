// Special Fibonacci
// Sankalp recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers. He defined them as follows:

//  f(0) = a;
//  f(1) = b;
//  f(n) = f(n-1) ^ f(n-2);  when n>1, where ^ denotes the bitwise xor operation.
